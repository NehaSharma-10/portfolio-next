                        In 2019, during my undergraduate studies, I found myself
                        increasingly drawn to the world of frontend development. What
                        started as curiosity quickly turned into a passion, and I immersed
                        myself in learning how to build engaging, user-friendly websites.

                        Fast forward to today, and I’ve had the privilege of working on
                        projects ranging from dynamic portfolios to complex e-commerce
                        platforms. My main focus these days is building intuitive and
                        responsive user interfaces that provide a seamless experience for
                        users. I love working at the intersection of design and
                        engineering—where things not only look great but perform efficiently
                        under the hood.

                        When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new tech trends,
                        catching up on my favorite reads, or simply enjoying time with
                        friends and family.
